# Angular Budget App

## Introduction

In this project, you'll create a budgeting application using Angular. This app will help users manage their incomes and expenses, track their balance, and save money by setting saving targets.

## Description

In the Budget App, users will be able to:

1. Record both incomes and expenses.
2. Check their balance.
3. Manage the saving:
   - Set a targeted saving amount.
   - Transfer money into or out of the saving account.
   - View their progress towards reaching the saving target.

## Guidelines

1. Creating components:

- Use the Angular CLI to generate the main components for the app:

  ```
  ng generate component transaction
  ng generate component balance
  ng generate component saving
  ```

2. `TransactionComponent`: This component can be reused for both Income and Expense entries.

3. `BalanceComponent`: Displays the current balance and provides options to transfer money to the saving account.

4. `SavingsComponent`: Allows setting a saving target and displays a progress bar.
